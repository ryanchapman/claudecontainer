# claude container

Don't let claude run commands on your computer, run claude in a container!

## Overview

The idea here is by running claude code in a container, you get to pick what files claude can see and edit.  
It obviously cannot execute anything it wants on your host computer; it can just run commands inside the container.

### Requirements

Users must:
- Have a valid Claude Code license/subscription from Anthropic

- Obtain Claude Code through official Anthropic channels

## Usage

You can expose one directory to claude code using this repo. 

```
./claude.sh <directory_to_expose_to_claude_container>
```

For example, if you want to work on the nginx project, and have the source stored in `~/src/nginx`,
you would run:

```
./claude.sh ~/src/nginx
```

```
ryan@MacBookPro:~/src/claudecode$ ./claude.sh ~/src/nginx
[+] Running 1/1
 âœ” Container claudecode  Started                                                                                                   10.2s
node@f2267f64de35:/src/nginx$
```

Since the directory is shared into the container with read-write permissions, any changes
made by claude inside the container will be saved to your host machine.

## Faster access

A trick for faster invocation is to symlink `claude.sh` into your `~/bin` directory:

```
(mkdir -p ~/bin && cd ~/bin && ln -sf ~/src/claudecontainer/claude.sh .)
```

Make sure `~/bin` is path of your `$PATH`.  If not, add this to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`:

```
export PATH="~/bin:$PATH"
```

Not you can run `claude.sh` from any directory:

```
claude.sh ~/src/nginx
```

## Where does this repo get claude code from?

The `claude.sh` script will download claude code's Dockerfile from:
https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile

It also downloads the firewall initialization script that Anthropic has published from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code/refs/heads/main/.devcontainer/init-firewall.sh

Both of these files are stored in `./claudecode/`.  Each time `./claude.sh` is run, it will check
to see if those files exist, and if not, will download them from the above URLs.

### Getting latest 

If you want to get the latest `Dockerfile` and `init-firewall.sh`, run:

```
rm ./claudecode/Dockerfile ./claudecode/init-firewall.sh
```

then re-run your `./claude.sh <directory_to_share>` command.
